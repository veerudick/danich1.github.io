# Online CV 
This repository is a fork from the [sharu725/online-cv](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv) repository where majority of the code for the template resides.
I have edited the code to incorporate my personal information and serve as an online CV.
Credit for the template code is in the Credits section below.
